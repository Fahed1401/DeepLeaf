## Introduction

DeepLeaf project aims to revolutionize plant disease management by utilizing machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) technologies. With plant diseases causing up to 40% of global crop losses annually,
DeepLeaf addresses the urgent need for accurate, automated solutions in agriculture. By improving disease
detection accuracy by over 90%, this project supports global food security and aligns with SDG Goal 3:
Good Health and Well-being, potentially saving millions in agricultural losses and contributing to sustainable
farming practices.
